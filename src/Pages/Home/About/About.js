          Hospitality is among the most important elements in the restaurant industry, making customer service essential for success. Regardless of whether a restaurant has high quality ingredients, they cannot attract and keep loyal patrons if they have poor customer service.

          Owners must take the time to choose the appropriate restaurant service model and train their employees to provide excellent customer service.
